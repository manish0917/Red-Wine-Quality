# Red-Wine-Quality

Red Wine Quality Prediction using KNN.

Red wine variant of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine refers to Portuguese wine that originated in the historic Minho province in the far north of the country. The main goal of this problem is to find which features of these kinds of wine are the ones that provide most information about its quality. We will also try to make a prediction of a wine's quality and check if it matches with the real quality. Although this dataset can be viewed as a classification (multiclass classification) or a regression problem, we will solve it using regression techniques.

## Data Information
fixed acidity: :most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily).

volatile acidity: the amount of acetic acid in wine, which at too high of levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.

citric acid: found in small quantities, citric acid can add 'freshness' and flavor to wines.

residual sugar: the amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops, it's rare to find wines with less than 1 gram/liter and wines with greater than 45 grams/liter are considered sweet.

chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine.

free sulfur dioxide: the free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.

total sulfur dioxide: amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine.

density: the density of wine is close to that of water depending on the percent alcohol and sugar content.

pH: describes how acidic or basic a wine is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic); most wines are between 3-4 on the pH scale.

sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.

alcohol: the percent alcohol content of the wine.

quality: output variable (based on sensory data, score between 0 and 10).
